### Layout of the Website
`index.html` and `portfolio.css` construct the portfolio website, while `contactme.html` and `contactme.css` construct the contact-me page. 

The "Contact" button on the navigation bar leads to a survey/ questionnaire I built, also in HTML5 and CSS3, and it is not (yet) connected to my email. 

The `fresh_tomatoes-copy.html` file is the Movie Website I built (link here: https://github.com/axtang/Movie-Website), and a link to this project is in the Portfolio.

Prior to the Project Gallery, of which the movie website was included in, a little introduction of myself is included.

A button and few social media icons can be found in the footer. If you click into any of them, it will take you to the web page of my corresponding social media account.

### Note to reviewer
Please notice that I only included 2 pictures (instead of 4 by requirement on the rubric) in this Portfolio page. 

One of the picture was the Udacity logo and the other one is for the Movie Website.
