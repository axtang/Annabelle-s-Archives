Personal Website | Progression Archive -- This is a website where I keep track of the projects I've worked on and links to find me on social media.

## Getting Started
This website is written in **Python (3.6), HTML5, and CSS3**. It contains 5 major files: `index.html`, `portfolio.css`, `contactme.html`, `contactme.css`, and `fresh_tomatoes-copy.html`. 

I wrote the code on a text editor called Sublime, and the code has only been tested on Chrome.

## Layout of the Website
This website has responsive layouts.

`index.html` and `portfolio.css` construct the portfolio website, while `contactme.html` and `contactme.css` construct the contact-me page. 

The "Contact" button on the navigation bar leads to a survey/ questionnaire I built, also in HTML5 and CSS3, and it is not (yet) connected to my email. 

The `fresh_tomatoes-copy.html` file is the Movie Website I built (link here: https://github.com/axtang/Movie-Website), and a link to this project is in the Portfolio.

Prior to the Project Gallery, of which the movie website was included in, a little introduction of myself is included.

A button and few social media icons can be found in the footer. If you click into any of them, it will take you to the web page of my corresponding social media account.

### Note to reviewer
Please notice that I only included 2 pictures (instead of 3 by requirement on the rubric) in this Portfolio page. 

One of the picture was the Udacity logo and the other one is for the Movie Website. 

I just want to keep this portfolio website cluttered from non-new-project-related pictures, and keep visitors' attention only on the essentials things, such as the projects and ways to contact me.

This website will be updated as soon as I have created new projects.

Additionally, I have been trying to let Github host this website but have not been successful with it. 

I will keep trying to work it through.

## Acknowledgement
Thank you for visiting my website :)
